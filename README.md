# TimeCapsule
This is a concept idea for the app called TimeCapsule , where you can upload yourselves online.

Using journaling as frontend and RLHF in the background for learning the personality of the human as backend , we are trying to give LLMs the capability of mimicing users writing style and eventually move on to mimic humans personas , by connecting to digital/physical products (spotify , socials , wearables etc.).
